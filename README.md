This is a prototype using Python and NetworkX to simulate graph isomorphism and SageMath to investigate graph automorphism.

The graph isomorphism is in Python and can be run easily on local machines with Anaconda suite installed.

The graph automorphism code is in Sage Math. You can run the code in Jupyter notebook if you have a local installation of SageMath in your system. Refer to https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/index.html for information on the installation process

Else you can run the codes in online Sage Cell Server by accessing the link, https://sagecell.sagemath.org/
